# How to solve problems

1. Analytic skills
You need to understand the "why" of solving the solutions in the course. Not memorizing the solutions.

2. Coding skills
Algorithms and data structures, will cover just the basic ones used in interviews, not every one that exists.
The interviews are a way to weed out people who didn't prepare for the interview process, not that you will use these algorithms in the job.

Questions to ask
 - how many items
 - what are they looking for, e..g performance, memory efficiently
 - repeating items
 - items in sequence
 - confirm input/output parameters

3. Technical skills
4. Communication skills
