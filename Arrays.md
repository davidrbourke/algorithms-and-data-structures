#  Arrays

Lists that order items sequentially
Stored in contioguous memory, smallest footprint

Lookup, Push is O(1)
Insert, Delete O(n)



# Static Vs Dynamic Arrays
- Static are fixed in size, need to specify the number of elements in the array when it is created, e.g. an Array in C#.
- Dynamic allow an array to be copied and rebuilt at a new location, e.g. a List in C#.
